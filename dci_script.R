##### Import data #####

# Import rivers from MELCC's GRHQ (RH_L layer)
# https://www.donneesquebec.ca/recherche/dataset/grhq

# https://www.donneesquebec.ca/recherche/dataset/structure
culverts <- read_sf("")

# Import waterfalls from MELCC' GRHQ (C_hyd_p layer)

##### Prepare rivers #####

# Clean river data

  # Discard Z dimension (sf cannot work with Z or M data)
  st_zm() %>%
  # Filter rivers with ENABLED set to 1
  filter(ENABLED == 1) %>%

# Clip rivers to Quebec boundary and add rivers to connect outlets
# Recommended to be done in GIS software
# Export rivers

# Initial import to dci to remove small fragments
rivers <- import_rivers(rivers)

# Detect topological errors
rivers_err <- enforce_dendritic(rivers, correct = FALSE)
# Export river errors

# Should be corrected then rerun until no errors remain

##### Prepare barriers & outlet #####

# Import outlet

# For example using the CRHQ
# https://www.donneesquebec.ca/recherche/dataset/crhq
# Export rivers
